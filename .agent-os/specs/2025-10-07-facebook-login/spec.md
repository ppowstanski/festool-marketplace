## Overview

Implement Facebook OAuth authentication that allows users to log in with their Facebook account and grants permissions to publish posts to Facebook groups.

## User Stories

### Seller Wants to Access the App

As a Festool tool seller, I want to log in with my Facebook account, so that I can create marketplace posts without creating a new account.

**Workflow:**
1. User visits the app landing page
2. Sees a prominent "Login with Facebook" button
3. Clicks the button and is redirected to Facebook OAuth
4. Grants permissions (public_profile, publish_to_groups, groups_access_member_info)
5. Returns to the app and sees the post creation form
6. User's profile info (name, profile picture) appears in the header

### Returning User Stays Logged In

As a returning user, I want to stay logged in across sessions, so that I don't have to authenticate every time I visit the app.

**Workflow:**
1. User has previously logged in
2. Returns to the app (same browser)
3. App automatically recognizes the authenticated session
4. User goes directly to the post creation form

### User Wants to Log Out

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out, so that I can secure my account when using a shared computer.

**Workflow:**
1. User clicks logout button in header
2. Session is cleared
3. User returns to landing page with login button

## Spec Scope

1. **Facebook OAuth Integration** - Implement Facebook Login SDK with redirect flow
2. **Permission Requests** - Request publish_to_groups, groups_access_member_info, and public_profile permissions
3. **Session Management** - Store and persist authentication state using localStorage
4. **User Profile Display** - Show user's name and profile picture in app header when logged in
5. **Logout Functionality** - Clear session and return user to login screen

## Out of Scope

- User settings or profile management (beyond basic display)
- Account deletion or data management features
- Multiple Facebook account switching
- Role-based access control or admin features

## Expected Deliverable

1. User can successfully authenticate using Facebook Login from the landing page
2. App requests and receives necessary permissions (publish_to_groups, groups_access_member_info, public_profile)
3. Authenticated users see their profile info in the header and can access the main app
4. Users remain logged in across browser sessions until they explicitly log out
5. Logout button successfully clears authentication and returns to landing page
