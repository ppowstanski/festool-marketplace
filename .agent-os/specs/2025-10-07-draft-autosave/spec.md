# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Draft Auto-Save
> Created: 2025-10-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement automatic draft saving functionality that persists form data to localStorage, allowing users to safely close the app and resume their listing later without losing work.

## User Stories

### Accidental Data Loss Prevention

As a seller filling out a listing form, I want my progress to be automatically saved, so that if I accidentally close the browser or navigate away, I don't lose all my work.

**Workflow**: User fills out several fields in the listing form → closes browser tab accidentally → reopens app → all previously entered data is restored automatically.

### Resume Interrupted Work

As a seller with limited time, I want to start a listing and finish it later, so that I can work on my listing in multiple sessions without manually saving.

**Workflow**: User fills out half the form → deliberately closes app to handle other tasks → returns later → continues exactly where they left off.

### Clear Completed Drafts

As a seller who just posted a listing, I want the draft to be automatically cleared after successful posting, so that I start with a fresh form for my next listing.

**Workflow**: User completes and posts listing → draft is automatically removed from storage → next time they visit, they start with a clean form.

## Spec Scope

1. **Auto-save on Change** - Automatically save form data to localStorage whenever any field changes (debounced to prevent excessive writes)
2. **Auto-restore on Load** - When the app loads, check for existing draft and restore it to the form
3. **Draft Indicator** - Show visual indicator when a draft exists with timestamp
4. **Clear Draft Action** - Allow user to manually discard draft and start fresh
5. **Auto-clear on Submit** - Automatically remove draft from storage after successful post submission

## Out of Scope

- Multiple draft support (saving more than one listing at a time)
- Draft list/management UI
- Cloud sync of drafts across devices
- Draft version history or undo functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. User can fill out form, close browser, and reopen to find all data restored
2. Visual indicator shows "Draft saved" timestamp when draft exists
3. "Discard draft" button clears saved data and resets form
4. Draft is automatically cleared after successful post submission
