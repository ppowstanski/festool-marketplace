## Pitch

Festool Marketplace is a post formatting tool that helps sellers in Festool second-hand tool Facebook groups create standardized, professional listings by providing a structured form template that generates perfectly formatted posts ready to copy and paste into the group.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Sellers**: Members of Festool Facebook groups who want to sell their used Festool tools with professional-looking posts
- **Group Administrators**: Moderators who want consistent, well-formatted posts in their marketplace groups

### User Personas

**DIY Enthusiast & Tool Collector** (25-55 years old)
- **Role:** Hobbyist woodworker, contractor, or professional tradesperson
- **Context:** Active member of Festool Facebook community groups, occasionally buying and selling used tools
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent post formats make listings look unprofessional, forgetting to include important details like model number or condition, time-consuming to format posts properly
- **Goals:** Sell tools quickly at fair prices, maintain good reputation in the community, create professional-looking listings without effort

## The Problem

### Inconsistent Marketplace Listings

Facebook group posts for selling tools often lack essential information, have poor formatting, and vary wildly in quality. This makes it harder for buyers to make decisions and reduces trust in listings.

**Our Solution:** Provide a structured form that ensures every listing includes all necessary information in a consistent, professional format.

### Time-Consuming Post Creation

Creating well-formatted posts manually takes time and effort, especially when trying to remember all the details that should be included.

**Our Solution:** A simple form interface that guides users through entering all relevant information and automatically formats it into a professional post template ready to copy and paste.

### Facebook Groups API Limitations

Meta deprecated the Facebook Groups API in April 2024, making it impossible for third-party apps to post directly to groups. This limits automation options but doesn't eliminate the value of standardized formatting.

**Our Solution:** Generate perfectly formatted posts that users can quickly copy to clipboard and paste into Facebook groups - still saving time and ensuring consistency without requiring API access.

## Differentiators

### Festool Community Focus

Unlike generic marketplace platforms, we're specifically designed for the Festool second-hand tool community on Facebook, where sellers already gather. No need to migrate to a new platform.

### Template-Based Consistency

Unlike free-form Facebook posts, we enforce a standardized template that ensures all listings contain complete information, improving buyer confidence and reducing back-and-forth questions.

### Clipboard-Based Simplicity

While the Facebook Groups API is no longer available, our clipboard-based approach is actually simpler and more reliable than API integrations - no authentication issues, no rate limits, no API changes breaking functionality.
