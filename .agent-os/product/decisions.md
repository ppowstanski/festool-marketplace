## 2025-10-07: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Build a Facebook-integrated marketplace posting tool for the Festool second-hand tools community. The app will provide a standardized form template that publishes directly to Facebook groups, ensuring consistent, professional listings for sellers of used Festool tools.

### Context

The Festool Facebook group currently has inconsistent post formats for marketplace listings. Sellers often forget to include essential information like model numbers, condition details, or proper pricing. This creates friction for buyers and makes the marketplace less efficient. By providing a structured form that enforces a consistent template, we can improve the quality of listings and make the buying/selling experience better for everyone.

The community already exists on Facebook, so integrating with the platform where users are active is more practical than building a standalone marketplace that would require user migration.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standalone Marketplace Website**
   - Pros: Full control over features, no Facebook API limitations, can build custom matching/search
   - Cons: Would need to migrate existing community, harder to get adoption, more complex infrastructure

2. **Facebook Group Rules/Pinned Template**
   - Pros: No development needed, simple to implement
   - Cons: Manual enforcement, users still forget or ignore templates, no automation

3. **Browser Extension**
   - Pros: Works directly in Facebook interface
   - Cons: Limited to desktop, requires installation, browser-specific development

### Rationale

We chose the Facebook-integrated web app approach because:
- It meets users where they already are (in the Facebook group)
- Provides automation while maintaining the social aspect of the community
- Can be used on any device without installation
- Allows us to enforce consistency while keeping the experience simple
- Free hosting options make it cost-effective to launch and iterate

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved listing quality and consistency in the marketplace
- Reduced friction for sellers creating posts
- Better buyer experience with complete information
- Faster time to market with serverless architecture
- Low operating costs with free hosting tier

**Negative:**
- Dependent on Facebook Graph API and their policies
- Requires Facebook App Review for group posting permissions (may take time)
- Limited by Facebook's rate limits and API capabilities
- Cannot control Facebook's UI changes or deprecations
- Initial setup requires Facebook Developer account and app configuration

## 2025-10-07: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS 4.0 for the frontend, with a serverless architecture hosted on Vercel or Netlify. No backend database initially; use localStorage for drafts.

### Context

This is a small-scale application focused on form creation and Facebook API integration. The primary technical requirements are:
- Fast development iteration
- Mobile-responsive UI
- Facebook SDK integration
- Free or low-cost hosting
- Easy deployment and maintenance

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Next.js with API Routes**
   - Pros: Full-stack framework, API routes for backend logic, great Vercel integration
   - Cons: More complex than needed for this simple use case, API routes unnecessary when using Facebook API directly

2. **Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
   - Pros: Simplest possible approach, no build step
   - Cons: Harder to maintain, poor developer experience, no component reusability

3. **Vue.js or Angular**
   - Pros: Good frameworks with strong ecosystems
   - Cons: Team preference for React, larger learning curve for this project

### Rationale

- **React + TypeScript**: Familiar to development team, excellent ecosystem, type safety reduces bugs
- **Vite**: Extremely fast builds, modern tooling, great developer experience
- **TailwindCSS 4.0**: Rapid UI development, consistent design, mobile-first approach
- **Serverless hosting**: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, free tier sufficient for MVP
- **No backend initially**: Reduces complexity, faster MVP, can add later if needed

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast development velocity
- Minimal operational overhead
- Zero hosting costs initially
- Easy to add backend later if needed (Firebase/Supabase)
- Modern, maintainable codebase

**Negative:**
- Limited by client-side storage for drafts (localStorage)
- Cannot implement server-side features without adding backend later
- All API calls happen from client (Facebook API keys visible, though this is standard for Facebook SDK)
- No server-side rendering (not critical for this app)
